# ðŸš€ rocket-tasks

Project of tasks management app.

I ve come up with idea of this app during my work in sales department of homecloud (home.pl). 
We ran into problem that e-mails from clients with a desire to buy server were not distributed evenly among sellers. 
Rocket tasks is ment to work with cerb, but during development it is set up to work with Stackoverflow. When user sees a potential sale he uses chrome extension
and with a right click marks mail as new task. Task is then assigned to the next salesperson and he is informed by mail about more details. 
User can filter all tasks in web app, report work progress, and compare all the necessary statistics.Â
